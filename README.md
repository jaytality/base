# Base Project

This is a base project kit - so that you can locally run a docker for testing/development. The same folder can then be deployed to a web server using
the infrastructure projects.

This project was developed specifically with Laravel in mind

## Usage

1. run `init.sh` to clear out the existing git repo files
2. clone your appropriate repo to `./code`
3. update the `.env` in the root folder to your needs
4. update and configure the laravel stuff in `./code`
